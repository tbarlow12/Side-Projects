Consider a healthcare database. For every person, we need to record, the person’s SSN, birthdate,
gender, height and weight. For male records, the users also want to know the percent of body muscle
mass, while for female records they want to know the the testosterone level. Moreover, our database
should be able to store or deduce the biological mother, father and children of each person. Finally,
there are different tests (with unique names, like ’red-blood-cell-count’, ’cholesterole-level’), which may
be administered zero or more times on each person. For each administered test, our users need to know
the name of the test, the date, the person and the result (assuming this is always numerical) of the test.
